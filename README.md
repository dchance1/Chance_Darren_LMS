**Library Management System (LMS)**

Library Management System is a console-based  application. 

This application is developed to help users maintain a
collection of books. The user will have the ability to add new books to the collection, remove a book from the
collection using its ID number and lastly list all books currently in the collection. The data will be stored in a
text file and be formatted as follows:<br><br>
<p>(ID Number,Title,Author)</p>
<p>1,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee<br>
<p>2,1984,George Orwell<br>
<p>3,The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald<br><br>
<p>
This class presents the user with a menu of the following 4 options: display book collection, remove a book from
collection, add a book to the collection, end application. This call will make calls to the classes Databse.java and
Book.java to store data and access necessary fuctions for viewing and manipulation of data.
